        Jean-Michel Basquiat was born on 22 December 1960, in Brooklyn, New York. His father, 
        Gérard, was born in Port au Prince, Haiti, and his mother Matilde was a New York-native of 
        Puerto Rican descent. In this multicultural home, the artist grew up speaking Spanish,
         French and English.

            Basquiat has sometimes been portrayed as having escaped poverty. In reality, he was the educated son of a middle-class Haitian-Puerto Rican family, who set his sights on a career in art. Vital to that career was
            meeting and becoming friends with Andy Warhol a few months after he met Jennifer Stein.

            Basquiat became a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum, his favorite museum, at the age of six. In the spring of 2018, the museum hosted One Basquiat an
             exhibition devoted solely to the artist's record-breaking Untitled (1982) which was purchased at Sotheby's by Japanese collector 
            Yusaku Maezawa for $110.5 million dollars — the most ever paid for an American artist at auction.

            At eight-years-old, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street and suffered a broken arm and severe internal injuries. While he was recuperating, his mother brought him a copy of the foundational medical textbook Gray’s Anatomy. The volume’s detailed anatomical drawings were eye opening to the young artist. Years later Basquiat named his industrial art noise band Gray 
            (which counted actor Vincent Gallo as a member) in homage to this early influence.

            It was his graffiti tag “SAMO” (shorthand for “same old shit”) that first drew public attention. Basquiat created “SAMO” with his friend Al Diaz while the pair were in high school and the tag,which often featured the copyright symbol, cropped up on buildings throughout lower Manhattan and Brooklyn between 1977 and 1980. "It was supposed to be a logo, like Pepsi.” Basquiat later told writer Anthony Haden-Guest. 
            The end of the collaboration was announced in 1980 through a slue of tags declaring, “SAMO is dead.”
